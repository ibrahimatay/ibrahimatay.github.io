## Application Modernization

As your systems grow, they become more complex. It becomes increasingly difficult to respond to business needs promptly. That's where modernization comes in. Sometimes you need to break down monoliths into microservices, refactor existing systems, or move to the cloud. Regardless of the path, your critical applications must remain healthy for the long term.

I've spent years working with finance, insurance, and high-throughput systems. That hands-on experience helps me guide organizations through modernization. I rely on proven approaches like domain-driven design and event-driven architecture. We work together from planning through execution, step by step. The result is robust, well-built systems that are actually maintainable.

## Architectural Assessments

When a team's productivity slows down, it's rarely just about technical debt. Often it's deeper: team structure, how you organize work, the tech choices you've made. I don't just look at the code. I look at your whole system.

I identify the real bottlenecks: complex integrations, tight coupling, workflows that don't flow. Then we work together to define what the target architecture should look like. From there, we build a practical roadmap you can follow step by step. The goal is simple: help your teams move fast, keep systems sustainable, and stay flexible as things change.
